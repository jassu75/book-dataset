# Data Analysis of Book Dataset
This project was made by Tejas v Kangod. This is to data analyse a book dataset of size 100000*16. The objective was to extract useful information from the dataset. This was then represented using appropriate tools. Furthermore, algorithms were implemented in order to identify unique patterns and relationships in the dataset.
